# team_41_automated-text-summarization
The motive of this project is about building an automated text summarizer that takes input texts and outputs corredsponding summaries particulary it processes the human speech to create the input texts after deploying the model. The model that was built was of Transformer architecture that has custom multi-layered encoders that work on the outputs of preceding encoder and the starting first level encoder takes input texts alongside the custom multi-layered encoders we have custom multi-layered decoders that takes keys,values of the last layer of the multi-layered encoder and processes it with the queries of the output summaries while training and calculating loss and updating the parameters based on backpropogation from loss.
So, first the dataset
